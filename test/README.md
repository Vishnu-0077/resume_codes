# GPU Image Processor

A simple Python utility for loading and processing images on GPU using PyTorch. This tool automatically detects GPU availability and processes images with CUDA acceleration when available, falling back to CPU processing when necessary.

## 🌟 Features

- Automatic GPU/CPU detection and selection
- Image loading with PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- Image preprocessing with torchvision transforms
- Batch dimension handling for neural network compatibility
- Error handling for missing image files
- Memory-efficient tensor operations

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

Python >= 3.7
PyTorch >= 1.9.0
torchvision >= 0.10.0
Pillow (PIL) >= 8.0.0

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gpu-image-processor.git
cd gpu-image-processor

text

2. Install required dependencies
pip install torch torchvision pillow

text

Or if you have a requirements.txt:
pip install -r requirements.txt

text

## 📖 Usage

### Basic Usage

from load_image_gpu import process_image_on_gpu

Process an image
image_path = "/path/to/your/image.jpg"
image_tensor = process_image_on_gpu(image_path)

if image_tensor is not None:
print(f"Image loaded on: {image_tensor.device}")
print(f"Image shape: {image_tensor.shape}")

text

### Function Parameters

The `process_image_on_gpu()` function accepts:
- `image_path` (str): Path to the input image file

### Output

Returns a PyTorch tensor with:
- Shape: `[1, 3, 256, 256]` (batch_size, channels, height, width)
- Device: CUDA GPU if available, otherwise CPU
- Data type: Float32
- Value range: [0, 1] (normalized pixel values)

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Image Processing Pipeline

1. **Device Detection**: Automatically detects CUDA availability
2. **Image Loading**: Opens image file using PIL and converts to RGB
3. **Preprocessing**: 
   - Converts PIL image to PyTorch tensor
   - Resizes image to 256x256 pixels
4. **Batch Processing**: Adds batch dimension for neural network compatibility
5. **GPU Transfer**: Moves tensor to GPU memory if available

### Supported Image Formats

- JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- PNG (.png)
- BMP (.bmp)
- TIFF (.tiff)
- And other formats supported by PIL

## 🔧 Configuration

You can modify the image processing parameters by editing the transform pipeline:

transform = transforms.Compose([
transforms.ToTensor(),
transforms.Resize((256, 256)), # Change dimensions here
# Add more transforms as needed:
# transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
])

## 🚨 Error Handling

The code includes robust error handling for:
- **File Not Found**: Returns `None` if image path doesn't exist
- **GPU Unavailable**: Automatically falls back to CPU processing
- **Invalid Image Format**: PIL handles most format errors gracefully

## 🔍 Example Output

Using device: cuda
Image tensor loaded onto: cuda:0
Image tensor shape: torch.Size()
